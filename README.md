# üç∑ Wine Quality Classification

## üöÄ Overview
This project focuses on training a machine learning model to classify wine quality into **high** or **low** categories. The goal is to build an accurate, balanced, and robust classifier that helps distinguish wine quality effectively using advanced algorithms.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure
The project is divided into several key stages:

1. **Data Analysis and Preprocessing**  
   - Cleaning and preparing the dataset.  
   - Reducing classes to balance the dataset and simplify classification (high vs. low quality).  
   - Addressing overfitting to ensure the model generalizes well.

2. **Model Selection**  
   - Quick evaluation of various models to shortlist the best candidates.

3. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Detailed study of the top three models based on performance metrics:  
     - **XGBoost**  
     - **Random Forest**  
     - **LightGBM**

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**  
   - Hyperparameters are fine-tuned independently in three separate Colab notebooks for each shortlisted model.

5. **Final Model Selection**  
   - XGBoost is chosen as the final model due to its superior performance.  
   - The final Colab notebook summarizes and showcases the selected XGBoost model.

## üìä Performance Summary

The final XGBoost model‚Äôs performance on the test set (with a custom threshold) is as follows:

| Class            | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Support |
|------------------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| Low Quality (0)  |   0.819   | 0.819  |  0.819   |   149   |
| High Quality (1) |   0.842   | 0.842  |  0.842   |   171   |

**Overall metrics:**

- Accuracy: **83.1%**
- Macro Avg F1-Score: **0.830**
- Weighted Avg F1-Score: **0.831**
- ROC-AUC: **0.897**
